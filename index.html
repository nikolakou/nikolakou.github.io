        This paper examines the role of housing market segmentation in shaping house price movements and propagating macroeconomic shocks. To this end, I develop a dynamic assignment model in which households purchase indivisible housing units of heterogeneous quality. The presence of market segmentation implies that there is a continuum of prices within a housing market -- one for each type of house. I analytically characterize the response of the cross-sectional distribution of house prices to changes in credit, interest rates, and future economic conditions. In contrast to models with a homogeneous housing stock, I find that shocks propagate within the housing market unidirectionally: changes in households' willingness to pay for housing services "trickle up" in the quality ladder, but do not "trickle down". This fact implies that shocks that affect housing demand for low-income households (that purchase low-end homes) can have a large effect on average house prices through spillovers across quality tiers. I test the key theoretical prediction of unidirectional shock propagation using plausibly exogenous shocks to different quality segments of the housing market. Consistent with the theory, shocks that affect high-income households only induce changes in the prices of high-end homes, whereas shocks that affect low-income households affect house prices in the entire market.

        We study equilibria in a heterogeneous-agent incomplete-market economy with nominal government debt and flexible prices. Unlike in representative agent economies, steady-state equilibria exist when the government runs persistent deficits, provided that the level of deficits is not too large. In these equilibria, the real interest rate is below the growth rate of the economy. We quantify the maximum sustainable deficit for the US and show that it is lower under more redistributive tax and transfer systems. With constant primary deficits, there exist two steady-states, and the price level and inflation are not uniquely determined. We describe alternative policy settings that deliver uniqueness. We conduct quantitative experiments to illustrate how redistribution and precautionary saving amplify price level increases in response to fiscal helicopter drops, deficit expansions, and loose monetary policy. We show that rising primary deficits can account for a decline in the long-run real interest rate, leading to higher inflation for any given monetary policy. Our work highlights the role of household heterogeneity and market incompleteness in determining inflation.

        Many modern theories of the business cycle generate demand-driven fluctuations by assuming that monopolistic firms set a price in advance and commit to supplying the market-clearing quantity. In this paper, we enrich firms' supply decisions by allowing them to choose any supply function: a description of the price charged at each quantity of production. By changing only the strategy space of firms and leaving fixed all other microfoundations in a standard monetary business cycle model, we provide a novel theory in which the nature of uncertainty and market power endogenously determine the aggregate supply curve. We find that aggregate supply flattens when there is: (i) lower inflation uncertainty, (ii) greater demand uncertainty, and (iii) increased market power. Money is maximally non-neutral if firms' quantities are perfectly elastic to prices (price-setting) and neutral if only if firms' quantities are perfectly inelastic to prices (quantity-setting). When mapped to the data, our theory explains: (i) the long-run flattening of the aggregate supply curve as an outcome of more hawkish monetary policy and rising market power and (ii) the steepening of aggregate supply in times of high inflation uncertainty (e.g., the 1970s and 2020s) but not times of high real uncertainty (e.g., the Great Recession).

        Abstract

    	<div class="text">
        We present a model of exporter dynamics in which aggregate uncertainty is endogenous to the exporting decisions of firms within a given market. Exporting firms provide an imperfect signal regarding the returns to exporting to rival firms within the same industry. This creates an informational externality arising through the extensive margin that can lead to informational ``cascades" and multiple stochastic steady states in aggregate exports. The presence of this externality creates additional dynamic gains from the reduction in trade costs, which amplify the canonical static gains. The magnitude of these dynamic gains are decreasing in firm productivity dispersion and increasing in the (industry-level) elasticity of substitution. Our analysis suggests that temporary increases in trade costs can result in secular declines in aggregate exports through a permanent increase in firm-level uncertainty. We leverage text-based measures of uncertainty for OECD countries to test the theory.

        <p>"Rational Inattention: Signals and Precision."</p>
	
<button type="button" class="collapse">

    	<div class="text">
        This paper analyzes the continuous action rational inattention problem with binary states. I show that it is generally never optimal for an agent to acquire linearly dependent signals, which as a corollary implies that an agent will never choose more actions than there are states of the world. I demonstrate that the agent's optimal signal structure can be completely characterized through a single, univariate function. An intuitive condition on local convexity on this function determines the entire set of priors for which strictly positive information acquisition is optimal. Finally, I characterize state-dependent precision in information choice. In the widely used case of quadratic utility, I show that signal precision is invariant to the realization of the underlying state, thus providing a counterpart to the canonical Quadratic-Gaussian case when states are binary (Jung et al., 2019). I show that a necessary condition for state-dependent signal precision is variation in the convexity of marginal utility along the action space.
